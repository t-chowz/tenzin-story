There once was a student that never knew where to go eat, so her friend told her to go try Fugu and now it is her favorite place to eat, but then she went to chipotle and realized it's a lot better than Fugu

There was this man riding off into the sunset on a horse towards what appeared to be a train station. He was waiting for a train. He did not know where the train would take him, but he knew where he hoped it would.
The man approached the other man, and asked him about his opinions on Fugu and Chipotle. He said he wasn;t really familiar with fugu, but he know that Chipotle was really great, so he would likely prefer that. The other man asked if he wanted to go to Fugu with him so they could both experience both, and he said yes. So, the two men went to eat at Fugu and enjoyed it.
